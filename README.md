# Soph-Spring-SYS-265-Final-Project

Welcome to the Soph-Spring-SYS-265-Final-Project Wiki! This project was completed by Lily Pouliot, Savannah Ciak, and Diego Perez as a final project for their SYS265 (System Administration II) class at Champlain College. 

Our goal was to build a medium-sized enterprise from scratch using VMs that were deployed to us on Vcenter. We were tasked with completing this using GitHub issues, wiki, labels, milestones and boards -- most of which were unfamiliar to us before this. This documentation will include comprehensive build documentation and verification tests in the form of a simplified Requirements Verification Traceability Matrix (RVTM).
